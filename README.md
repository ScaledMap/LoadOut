# LoadOut
Pywebview application built on flask. Can run as a server or as a webview. LoadOut is an application I have been working to help manage and organize my bookmarks. It allows you to upload your bookmarks from firefox and create categories to interact with the bookmarks faster. I've found the most utility in using the application when I have it set as my homepage and it opens as a server. There are a lot of things I could probably do with this application. I hope I continue to add to it in the future. More customization would be nice. More default filters. I was thinking about trying to add rss. I actually think that would be a REALLY cool idea. For now though, I think I'm probably going to move on to a new application for a bit.
