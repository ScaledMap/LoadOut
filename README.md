# LoadOut
Pywebview application built on flask. Can run as a server or as a webview. LoadOut is an application I have been working to help manage and organize my bookmarks. It allows you to upload your bookmarks from firefox and create categories to interact with the bookmarks faster. It would also probably be useful for situations where you wan't to avoid messing with the keyboard. I had a setup at one point where i was using opera just because it made that type of thing easier. I've found the most utility in using the application when I have it set as my homepage and it opens as a server. There are a lot of things I could probably do with this application. I hope I continue to add to it in the future. More customization would be nice. More default filters. I was thinking about trying to add rss. I actually think that would be a REALLY cool idea. For now though, I think I'm probably going to move on to a new application for a bit. Really haven't had any motivation to  speak of over the last week or so. Want to mess around with javascript for a bit

The android application is hosted on github. I quit working on it a ways into the project. Got tired of repackaging it over and over again on a bunch of systems. The core application works on android though.
